My name is Sam Britt. I am an MS student in CS, specializing in
systems. I have no real relevant work experience; I co-oped as an
undergraduate in a materials research firm (my Bachelor's degree is in
materials science and engineering). I hope to work in embedded
software for devices. I am taking this course mostly to expand my
knowledge base; that is, as a \quotation{breadth course for Software
Engineering.} I'd like to be better (more formal, more
thorough) in testing and validating my software.
